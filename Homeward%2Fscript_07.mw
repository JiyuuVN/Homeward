    "It was the beginning of autumn, while the green leaves were beginning to turn red, when that event happened."
    "I lied on my bed, frustrated that I was bored, but too lazy to do anything. The daylight was peering through my shades, but only seemed to make my dimly lit room darker."
    "Through the walls, I could hear distant electronic music as Sora played a game downstairs."
    "It seemed like a quiet, dull day. Then my cellphone vibrated in my pocket, startling me."
    "I flipped it open and saw a text from Haruka asking me if I was free. I texted her back that I wasn't doing anything for the whole day."
    "Pretty soon, I got a response asking if I could meet her at the train station."
    "I wonder what was going on. Since I didn't have anything to do, I texted her back that I would meet her in half an hour and got out of my bed."
    "It was unusual for Haruka to text me out of the blue and ask me to meet her."
    "Usually, Nonami would come over to my house and throw a pebble at my window to get my attention (I never understood why she never knocked, that girl...) and then we'd go meet up Haruka at the station by default."
    "Whatever it was, it was probably important, so I better not keep Haruka waiting."
