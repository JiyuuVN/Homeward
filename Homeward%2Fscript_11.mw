    my life, since during that time span I moved, first, from Japan to Korea, then from Korea to Iowa, and then from Iowa to California. (Which are 
    like two different countries.) Before Homeward, I moved between three countries, and countless different homes throughout my life."

    Further, with the internet, culture is capable of being transmitted even quicker and more cheaply through different countries. 
    American culture flows into Japan and Japanese culture flows into America. And throughout that process, a new third culture is created. 
    this process continues throughout all nations of the world." 
    pause
    subtitle2 "The one trapped in a third culture can be a lonely existence. When you're in Japan, you miss the individuality of American culture, 
    but when you're in Japan, you miss the peace and quiet of Japanese culture. When you're in a new country, you miss your old country, but 
    when you're back in your old country, you realize you have little in common with it and you wish to leave. No matter where you are, you feel 
    like a foreigner. Every time you move, you lose everyone you know and held precious. After a while, you question why you should even make 
    friendships if all they will lead to is a painful farewell."

    currencies, you've rode the world's fastest trains, seen the world's biggest waterfalls, ate the food of the world, and most of all, you've 
    survived through all of it. You've gritted your teeth and learned to speak with people who do not understand a word of your language. 
    After spending a lifetime learning to become an adult, you've become a toddler again who can't speak more than a dozen words. And 
    you've become an adult again by learning to speak a new language. Again and again."

    it hasn't been written yet. It's the only part of life where you may have a choice. Nostalgia is a sweet poison. Sometimes, we rely on it to take 
    us away from the pain of separation. But hope, and determination to make a better future for yourself, is what drives you forward."
