    "It circled around my head twice, enticing me with its azure wings, before being carried away further by the wind."
    "Being the youthful boy I was then, I gave chase, drawn by its lollipop coloured wings."
    "I followed it across the grassy field, over the river, and finally, up a green hill where only a single tree stood."
    "By the time I reached the lonesome tree, I was exhausted."
    "My chest heaved in and out as I saw the butterfly flutter further up into the sky, towards the distant town, and eventually disappear."

    "The white buildings of the town glittered like fine rectangular crystals against the falling sun."
    "Divided by a sparkling river and surrounded by mountains on all sides, our town was like a small sanctuary in the middle of nature."
    ri "Amazing!"
    gi "Ahaha! I can see my home from here!"
    ri "Where, where?"
    gi "Ummm... It should be... right there!"

    ri "Then... I think my home's... right over there!"
    gi "Ehhh? You live just across the river from me!"
    ri "Which school do you go to?"
    gi "Kawada Elementary School."
    ri "Really? I go to Sakura Elementary, further down the road."
    gi "Alright! Then let's walk to school together from now on, okay?"

    "And so, a lost butterfly, brought by the wind and taken away just as unpredictably by the wind, lead me to Nonami Kitahara."
    "An act of random chance. Had the wind blown any other direction, had there been no butterfly, had I not been standing at that exact place at that exact time, I would never have met her."
    "An act of fate."
    
    "Like the notes of a piano, a hundred seemingly random noises come together to create a single melody."
    "Like the random, uncontrollable wind that brought me to Nonami that day, the same wind could just as easily take her away for eternity."
    "Chaos. The inescapable law of our lives."

    "It was about three years ago, when my father and I stopped by Japan for two days during summer vacation."
    "We had gone to a small restaurant together. Much of the details of that time were lost, but I still remember Sora eating an ice cream sundae with me."
    "She spoke hardly a word that time."
    "There was an emotionless, sad aura about her, like a frozen pond covered with snow."
    "Her eyes were unfocused, gazing blankly at the table underneath her. She never looked at my face."
    "That was all that I could recall from that day."
    "There was still a week left before she would move in."

    "The sun was now setting. The tree cast long shadows against the dirt ground, silhouetting it with a black pattern."
    ol "Times are a changing, young lad..."
    "From seemingly out of nowhere, an old lady appeared behind me."
    "Her back was bent with age and time had turned her hair thin and white."
    "She sat down on the bench beside me and looked at the tree with her tired, grey eyes."
    ol "I say, there was a time when this entire place was nothing but green. Now those young folk come in with that new mall and done changing everything."
    "I could barely understand the old lady's Japanese through her thick Kansai accent, so I just nodded politely."
    ol "Now, none of the birds even come around. Nobody to keep this old woman company."
    "She continued to speak. Out of respect for the elderly, I pretended to listen, even though I couldn't make out most of her words."
    ol "This old park is all that's left. All that's left of my old memories. Eh-heh... I guess that's why I like to come back here. Old habits are hard to kill..."
    "I wasn't sure what to say to the old lady, but I felt like I had to say something, lest she think I was ignoring her."
    ri "I used to come here often too."
    ol "Ooohhh, you did, did you?"
    ri "I always wanted to come back."
    ol "And why's that, my dear?"
    ri "There's someone I'm supposed to meet here. I hope she hasn't been waiting for too long."
    ol "Ohh... someone special, is it?"
    ri "... ... ..."
    ol "Well, I don't imagine a young lad like you'd be waiting on a old woman like me. Wahahaha."
    "A breeze blew through the park, filling the air with a flurry of white sakura petals. For a moment, it felt as if small puffs of snow were falling from the blue spring sky."
    "Nostalgia filled me. I had sat here long ago and watched the white petals softly glide to the ground before. The distant taste of old candy trickled from my mouth."
    "Had I been eating candy that day?"
    "Suddenly, I heard what sounded like a baseball bat being swung on the other side of the park. I turned my head and saw a lone kendoka practicing."
    "I watched quietly as the girl swung her bamboo sword over her head."
    "There was a kind of aesthetic beauty to it, to see a lone girl in traditional clothing gracefully cutting the air against the setting sun."
    "After swinging her sword for a few minutes, she stopped and bought a sports drink from a vending machine."
    "While she was drinking, she noticed me and waved."
    "I stood up and turned to bid my farewell to the old lady, but saw that she was now nowhere to be seen."
    "Huh, strange, she must have walked off while I was busy looking."

    ha "First, you need to cook the rice."
    "Haruka showed me a row of rice cookers to the side of the room."
    ha "First, you have to measure out the rice in this cup. One cup is one serving. Next, you rinse the rice with water a couple of times, then you add water up to the appropriate line on the rice bowl."
    ri "Yeah. Sounds pretty easy so far."
    ha "Since we'll be making two servings today, we'll just add two cups and add water up to the line for two servings."
    "Haruka then put the rice bowl into the cooker and turned it on."
    ha "Now, let's make some tamagoyaki."
    "She got out a package of butter, some salt and sugar, a carton of milk, and a carton of eggs from a grocery bag."
    ha "First, you crack two eggs in a bowl. You have to be careful not to get the shell into the bowl with the yolk."

    show haruka cook neutral with dissolve
    ha "Now, you add milk until it's approximately twice its original size. Then, you add a little bit of salt and sugar."
    ri "How much should I add?"
    ha "Ummm... I guess it kind of depends on your preference. I add about a teaspoon of salt and three teaspoons of sugar."
    ha "After you've done that, you just mix everything together."
    "I spun the contents of the bowl with a pair of chopsticks, until it turned into a solid light yellow batter."
    ha "Now, you melt a little bit of butter on the frying pan so that it doesn't stick, and then you pour it in."

    show haruka cook neutral with dissolve    
    ha "When you're doing this at home, it's generally not a good idea to use a frying pan that's too big, or else the batter will spread out too thin and it'll be hard to fold it."
    ri "I see..."
    ha "Now, while the batter is still kind of raw, you fold it a couple of times using the spatula."
    ha "Mmm... I guess this part's a little bit tricky. You have to make sure that the bottom's solid, while the top's still uncooked."
    "Haruka demonstrated by slipping her spatula underneath her batter and neatly folding it four times."
    "This looked a little bit difficult. I tried the same, but I ended up tearing the bottom of the batter."
    
    show haruka cook handsbehind forcedsmile with dissolve

    ha "To make everything look nice, you throw the sides out. Eh-heh, I always eat them so that I can see if they turned out okay."
    "Since mine wasn't folded entirely right, they kind of fell apart as I tried to cut them."

    "Haruka put away the ingredients for the tamagoyaki and got out some vegetable oil, a carrot, some asparagus, an onion, a package of mini sausages, and a bottle of soy sauce."
    ha "After you wash the vegetables, you peel the carrot and cut them into round slips."
    "I tried to imitate her, although though my carrot slips weren't as neat as hers."
    
    show haruka cook smile with dissolve
    ha "Eh-heh, I don't really like eating the stem of the asparagus, so I cut most of them out when I make mine."

    ha "But then, I always feel guilty about throwing them out, so I end up using them for decoration."
    
    show haruka cook neutral with dissolve
    ha "Now, you just have to cut the top and the bottom off the onion and then peel the outer skin off."
    ha "After that, I slice the onion horizontally into some circular slips. The \'o\' shape they make once you separate the layers looks interesting, don't you think?"
    ri "Uhn. Let's do that."

    "The pan sizzled as Haruka added the oil and stirred the vegetables with the spatula."
    ha "While it's cooking, I think it tastes better if you also add some soy sauce."
    "I followed her instructions and made some reasonably good looking stir fry."

    ha "You have to make sure the rice is mixed after you open the lid, or else you won't be able to eat it later."
    "After slipping her hands into a pair of oven mittens, she grabbed the rice bowl and brought it to our station."
    ha "Now, all we have to do is put all of the food into the bento box and decorate it."

    ha "And of course, we can't forget the red dried plum at the middle."
    "She brought out more ingredients."
    "We put the finishing touches on our bento boxes."

    "Before I moved abroad, my grandparents used to live here."
    "I remember, when my father had to go on business trips when I was little, he would always leave me with them."
    "I really didn't like it at all and would always cry and throw temper tantrums whenever that happened. Now that I looked back in retrospect, I felt sorry for the trouble I caused my grandparents."
    "Sora and I followed the old path, until we came upon an abandoned, boarded up building."
    "This place sure changed since I left."
    so "What is this place?"
    ri "It's where your grandparents used to live, Sora."
    "So I guess that meant that Sora had never come here."
    "It made sense, I suppose. They were my father's parents and probably didn't have much to do with my mother."
    "The entire house was now overgrown with weeds and was probably home to nothing but spiders and wild animals."

    "Luckily, it wasn't as blazing hot as it would have been had we come during the summer time, so the walk was pretty bearable."
    "Now if I recalled correctly, there was a mountain stream with a small cave further down the path."
    "We'd be able to spend the night there. I guess this was kind of like a camping trip now"

    "After walking for about an hour, we arrived at our destination."
    "Now that I was old enough to appreciate the beauty of nature, I was momentarily taken away by the scenic beauty of the mountain stream."
    "It was amazing how many times I had come here during my childhood and failed to notice it."
    ri "We're here, Sora."
    "Sora took off her shoes and soaked her feet into the water."
    so "Mmm..."
    "I knelt down and washed my face with a handful of water. As expected, it was freezing cold, but it was just what I needed after that long walk."
    "I grabbed our luggage bags and walked over to the cave."
    "It was a lot smaller than what I remembered and resembled more of a small pit on the side of the rocky cliff face, but was still large enough to accommodate the two of us."
    "For now, I thew our luggage bags in there and took a seat facing the stream."
    
    "Sora wandered around the crystal clear water in her bare feet."
    "Against the backdrop of the sylvan mountain, she looked truly stunning."
    "For a while, I just sat there, watching her."
    "We were probably the only humans anywhere near here. I wonder... did Adam feel this way when he gazed upon Eve in the Garden of Eden?"
    "A new sensation overtook me. All of a sudden, I felt the urge to gently smile. Somewhere inside of me, in the area right underneath my heart, I felt a sensation of complete relaxation and warmth."
    "I never wanted this feeling to stop..."
    "For just a second, I managed to deceive myself and believe that everything was going to be okay."
    "That Sora and I would spend the rest of our lives together..."
    "That our feelings for each other will never change."
    "That every morning, I would wake up and fight over who got to use the washroom first with her. That every evening, she would wander into my room to talk about the day's events with me."
    "But then reality soon struck me."
    "There was no way anyone would accept us being together."
    "And it honestly didn't matter anyways, because in just a few days now, I'll be hundreds of thousands of kilometers away from her."
    "At those thoughts, I felt myself short of breath and my eyes dry."
    "I saw Sora bend down and stare intently at a frog that was sitting as still as a statue on a river rock."
    "Suddenly, it hopped in her direction, causing Sora to yelp and nearly fall down on her butt in surprise."
    "At that, I forgot about my troubles and couldn't help but start to laugh."
    so "Muuu..."
    ri "Sorry, sorry."
    "I got off of my seat, took my shoes off, and joined Sora in the river."

    ri "W-what's wrong Sora?"
    "All of a sudden, a wicked smile came on her face and she kicked a massive splash of water into my face."

    ri "That's it. No more Mr. Nice Guy."
    "I let out a battle shout and lunged for Sora."
    "Giggling, she leapt out of the way and ran back for dry ground."
    "I gave chase, the both of us splashing up water as we ran along the mountain stream."    
    "Finally, I grabbed onto Sora just as we cleared the river and rolled down onto the grassy dirt with her."
    "I pinned her down and poked her in between her rib cage and her hips, sending her into a ticklish fit."

    "The clear mountain water gently lulled downstream, the sound of the water running past the river rocks resembling the sound a puppy makes when lapping up a bowl of water."
    "Every so often, the splash of a frog jumping into the stream added an unexpected note into the continuous hymn of nature that surrounded us."
    "Our lips parted and I gently lowered her head back down onto the grass. My face was in a state of blissful tranquility."

    "My mouth filled with pleasure as Sora's tongue circled around mine. All of a sudden, she stopped and released her tongue deep into my mouth. She must be wanting her turn now..."
    "I did my best to do the same... Sora's chest began to heave as she breathed in and out."

    "Sora seemed just as crazed and pulled down my pants, breathing in short gasps."

    subtitle2 "Homeward took three years to make. That's over one tenth of my life. Those three years were probably the most eventful years of 
    my life, since during that time span I moved, first, from Japan to Korea, then from Korea to Iowa, and then from Iowa to California. (Which are 
    like two different countries.) Before Homeward, I moved between three countries, and countless different homes throughout my life."
    pause
    subtitle2 "Today, culture is not limited to just a countries' borders. It flows as people move in and out of a country to other places. 
    Further, with the internet, culture is capable of being transmitted even quicker and more cheaply through different countries. 
    American culture flows into Japan and Japanese culture flows into America. And throughout that process, a new third culture is created. 
    this process continues throughout all nations of the world." 
    pause
    subtitle2 "The one trapped in a third culture can be a lonely existence. When you're in Japan, you miss the individuality of American culture, 
    but when you're in Japan, you miss the peace and quiet of Japanese culture. When you're in a new country, you miss your old country, but 
    when you're back in your old country, you realize you have little in common with it and you wish to leave. No matter where you are, you feel 
    like a foreigner. Every time you move, you lose everyone you know and held precious. After a while, you question why you should even make 
    friendships if all they will lead to is a painful farewell."
    pause
    subtitle2 "It can also be an exhilarating experience. You've been on adventures most people can only dream of. You've used different 
    currencies, you've rode the world's fastest trains, seen the world's biggest waterfalls, ate the food of the world, and most of all, you've 
    survived through all of it. You've gritted your teeth and learned to speak with people who do not understand a word of your language. 
    After spending a lifetime learning to become an adult, you've become a toddler again who can't speak more than a dozen words. And 
    you've become an adult again by learning to speak a new language. Again and again."
    pause
    subtitle2 "It is what makes us unique. It is not a curse. It brings both joy and misery."
    pause
    subtitle2 "No matter what, the today you live in now is better than what has gone by, and what will come in the future is even better - because  
    it hasn't been written yet. It's the only part of life where you may have a choice. Nostalgia is a sweet poison. Sometimes, we rely on it to take 
    us away from the pain of separation. But hope, and determination to make a better future for yourself, is what drives you forward."
    pause
    subtitle2 "There is no need to worry. If today is bad, then the probability is good that tomorrow will be better. All will work out in the end, 
    no matter how bleak life looks at any moment."
